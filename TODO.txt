LEFT OFF:
- Test findChild
- Test replaceChild
- Test find
- Test replace
- Get it so the find function only returns Mathobject and NOT null?
- Try creating variable 'WOW' - throws error
- Shouldn't the static constructor for expression need a sign? Are there more like that?
    - Add the additional operator stuff in to the new replace child in expression
- Write/test flipSign 
- Go through all the objects and start adding any other method tests needed
- start building basic simplifier
- Create tests for new EMPTY_PARAMETER function errors - USE STASH
    - Maybe only check for this error in the Factory class since that's the only place it might show up? The rest will be caught through constructor inputs
    - Create another test to make sure there aren't EXTRA parameters or not ENOUGH parameters
- Do I want doubles to remove the leading 0 in cases like '0.5'?


GENERAL RULES:
================
- I am allowing ambiguous rational inputs like a/b/c but it will make assumptions without ()
- I am allowing inputs of (a)(b) - it will assume these are two factors
- I am allowing a^b/c => ((a^(b))/(c))
- I am allowing a^b*c => a^(b)*c
