LEFT OFF:
- Create testing application - sepearate angular module
    - Create repo for general api
    - Decide how best to set up my data base
        - Have two tables with different types of data? Like a simple one with JUST primary keys and another for better indexing?
        - Maybe each app that uses it has an app id and then an indexing id?
    - Get a basic GET working for my table(s)
    - Get a basic create/update working
        - think about how I want to partition this stuff - if at all
    - Get a basic delete working
    - Look in to basic authentication
    - Create auth guard for dev vs prod for testing path
        - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54650746/angular-how-do-you-create-specific-routes-only-in-development-mode
- Add new operations!
    - Try to find old app and see what order I did things in and what I'm missing
- maybe combine the multiplication/addition/subtraction/zero factors/zero terms operators in to one?
- Starting to get the feeling that I SHOULD force exponents and num/denoms to be expressions
- Create tests for new EMPTY_PARAMETER function errors - USE STASH
    - Maybe only check for this error in the Factory class since that's the only place it might show up? The rest will be caught through constructor inputs
    - Create another test to make sure there aren't EXTRA parameters or not ENOUGH parameters
- Do I want doubles to remove the leading 0 in cases like '0.5'?


GENERAL RULES:
================
- I am allowing ambiguous rational inputs like a/b/c but it will make assumptions without ()
- I am allowing inputs of (a)(b) - it will assume these are two factors
- I am allowing a^b/c => ((a^(b))/(c))
- I am allowing a^b*c => a^(b)*c
