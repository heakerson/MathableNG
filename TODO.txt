LEFT OFF:
- I need to add the operation id to the change object
- I think I need to change how I'm setting the AFTER highlight objects? I need to find them WITHIN the new root object
    - create a getObjectAtPosition - update the position data
- Test the operation functions
- Create testing application - sepearate angular module
- Add new operations!
    - Try to find old app and see what order I did things in and what I'm missing
- maybe combine the multiplication/addition/subtraction/zero factors/zero terms operators in to one?
- inside services, create a 'Core' services and move the factory/error-handler/string formatter in to it
- Create tests for new EMPTY_PARAMETER function errors - USE STASH
    - Maybe only check for this error in the Factory class since that's the only place it might show up? The rest will be caught through constructor inputs
    - Create another test to make sure there aren't EXTRA parameters or not ENOUGH parameters
- Do I want doubles to remove the leading 0 in cases like '0.5'?


GENERAL RULES:
================
- I am allowing ambiguous rational inputs like a/b/c but it will make assumptions without ()
- I am allowing inputs of (a)(b) - it will assume these are two factors
- I am allowing a^b/c => ((a^(b))/(c))
- I am allowing a^b*c => a^(b)*c
