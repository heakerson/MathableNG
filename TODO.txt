LEFT OFF:
- TEST THE CONSTRUCTORS AND FUNCTIONS I JUST CREATED
- Create testing application - sepearate angular module
    - Decide on the structure of the test data and load it
        - test side
            - I think tests should be part of 'pages' so no one object gets to big - dynamodb record limits are 400kb
            - configuration
                - objectType
                - test page size
            - page
                - objectType
                - tests
            - test
                - objectType
                - input
                - solution object - will I need to create a special function for this?
    - make sure the tests are NOT updated in dev - ONLY LOCALLY
- Decide on the structure of the main app data and load it
- Add new operations!
    - Try to find old app and see what order I did things in and what I'm missing
- maybe combine the multiplication/addition/subtraction/zero factors/zero terms operators in to one?
- Starting to get the feeling that I SHOULD force exponents and num/denoms to be expressions
- Create tests for new EMPTY_PARAMETER function errors - USE STASH
    - Maybe only check for this error in the Factory class since that's the only place it might show up? The rest will be caught through constructor inputs
    - Create another test to make sure there aren't EXTRA parameters or not ENOUGH parameters
- Do I want doubles to remove the leading 0 in cases like '0.5'?


GENERAL RULES:
================
- I am allowing ambiguous rational inputs like a/b/c but it will make assumptions without ()
- I am allowing inputs of (a)(b) - it will assume these are two factors
- I am allowing a^b/c => ((a^(b))/(c))
- I am allowing a^b*c => a^(b)*c
