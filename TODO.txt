LEFT OFF:
- Start testing flipSign
    - Should I add a flip sign to term? If so, I should update replace child in expression
- start building basic simplifier
    - create a looping function that allows you to pass in a list of functions that return a LIST OF CHANGE OBJECTS
    - inside services, create a 'Core' services folder and a 'Math' services folder
- Create tests for new EMPTY_PARAMETER function errors - USE STASH
    - Maybe only check for this error in the Factory class since that's the only place it might show up? The rest will be caught through constructor inputs
    - Create another test to make sure there aren't EXTRA parameters or not ENOUGH parameters
- Do I want doubles to remove the leading 0 in cases like '0.5'?


GENERAL RULES:
================
- I am allowing ambiguous rational inputs like a/b/c but it will make assumptions without ()
- I am allowing inputs of (a)(b) - it will assume these are two factors
- I am allowing a^b/c => ((a^(b))/(c))
- I am allowing a^b*c => a^(b)*c
