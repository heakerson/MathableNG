- I think I need to change all of the constructors to accept strings and then create static constructors that accept objects
- How should I handle the following types of situations? They require editing the input slightly. I think I should do options 2 and store the
    original strings and the formatted strings AND FIX THE FAILING UNIT TEST
    - a+-b
        - Option 1 => a-b
        - Option 2 => a+(-b)
    - a--b
        - Option 1 => a+b
        - Option 2 => a--b
